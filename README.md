# The Monster Manual (GBC)
An 8-bit Adventure RPG with D&D Monsters!

## How to Build the ROM

### Depedencies
* [GBDK-2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) - The Game Boy Development
  kit. Includes the libraries and binaries for C development on the Game Boy.
* [GNU Make](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) - Build system
  tool (installation should only be required on Windows).
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) - Used to run custom tools I made in the course
  of developing the game.

### Use Make to Build the ROM
Update the `MakeFile` or define a shell variable named `GBDK_HOME` pointing to
the directory where you installed GBDK.

To build the ROM run the following commands:

* `npm install`
* `make assets`
* `make`
